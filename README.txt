This application is a tool for veterinarians to assist in dealing with horses suffering from colic. Colic is the leading cause of horse death worldwide. A model has been trained to receive input data from the  'veterinary colic examination modelâ€™ and output a survival percentage. 

This tool is to be used in real time. As a horse is checked up on over many weeks and new measurements are taken, the percentage will change. This is an invaluable indicator of how the horse is progressing. The veterinarian can then use this information to decide on what course of treatment will be most effective and appropriate.

An account system requires veterinarians to register their horses before predictions can be made. As predictions are made they are stored and accessed within the user dashboard. 

Not only does the application provide an invaluable functionality to the users but collects high quality prediction and horse data. This data can then be used to train and refine the model even further, or even to build other models.


Python was used to build the prediction model.

Flask is used to house the prediction model in its virtual environment.

React is used to create the front-end web application.

PHP is used to send information from the front end to the database.

mySQL is used to store the application data.


Instructions:

1. A user must register and login before any of the application features are available.

2. A horse must be registered before predictions can be made.
